# Tips
You have to change http://localhost/ to your server don't forget that
Go to your terminal and go to the app directory then type flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main to change the icon and type flutter pub run flutter_launcher_name:main to change the name of the app but first you have to change the app name and the app icon on the pubspec.yaml file
